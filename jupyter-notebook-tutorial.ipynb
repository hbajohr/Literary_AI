    "Jupyter Notebook gives you a convenient way to experiment with Python code, interspersing your experiments with notes and documentation. You can do all of this without having to muck about on the command line, and the resulting file can be easily published and shared with other people. In this course, I'll be using Jupyter Notebook to do in-class examples, and the notes will be made available as Jupyter Notebooks. Some of the homeworks will be assigned in the form of Jupyter Notebooks as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "An Jupyter Notebook consists of a number of \"cells,\" stacked on the page from top to bottom. Cells can have text or code in them. You can change a cell's type using the \"Cell\" dropdown menu at the top of the page; select either `Code` for Python code or `Markdown` for text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Text cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a new cell, change its type to `Markdown`, type some stuff and press `Ctrl-Enter`. Jupyter Notebook will \"render\" the text and display it on the page in rendered format. You can hit `Enter` or click in the cell to edit its contents again. Text in `Markdown` cells is rendered according to a set of conventions called Markdown. Markdown is a simple language for marking up text with basic text formatting information (such as bold, italics, hyperlinks, tables, etc.). [Here's a tutorial](http://markdowntutorial.com/). You'll also be learning Markdown in more detail in the Foundations course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code cells\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also press `Alt-Enter` (`Option-Enter` on Mac) to render the current cell and create a new cell. New cells will by default be `Code` cells. Try it now!"
