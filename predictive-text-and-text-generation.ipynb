    "# Text generation with Markov chains\n",
    "\n",
    "Adapted from a notebook by [Allison Parrish](http://www.decontextualize.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "In our last workshop, we looked at programs that use simple if-then rules to string together sentences. This is not the only way to make text. Another one calculates the statistical distribution of characters in a text. This is also the basis for modern machine learning, but before we look at this, we will learn about a much older process: Markov chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markov chains are a simple example of *predictive text generation*. It is a method of text generation that make use of statistical model that, given a certain stretch of text, *predicts* which bit of text should come next, based on probabilities learned from an existing corpus of text. It was first discussed by Andrey Markov in 1906, but became an important basis for information theory, particularly that of Claude Shannon (more about him next week). For the moment, it is enough to understand that statistic modeling of text *only looks at the distribution of characters, without any regard to their meaning*. However, as the Markov chain shows, the text is produces quickly becomes natural sounding. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, Markov chains are incredibly primitive compared to neural networks. But they allow one to develop an intuition for one of the most powerful ideas of modern natural language generation: That language can be synthesized without any regard to meaning, simply by using statistics. "

    "Before we get started, we'll first need some text! Grab two [plain text files from Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/) (or from another source of your choice) and save them to the same directory as this notebook. (I suggest working with two files because we'll be running some code explicitly to \"compare\" two texts. Also, I think seeing two different outputs from the text generation methods discussed in this notebook will help you better understand how those methods work.) The code in the following cell loads into Python variables the contents of *two plain text files*, assigned to variables `text_a` and `text_b`. You'll need to replace the filenames with the names of the files that you downloaded, keeping the quotation marks (`\"`) intact. Or you can just use the ones that I provided and change nothing."

    "The Markov models we created above don't just give us interesting statistical probabilities. It also allows us generate a *new* text with those probabilities by *chaining together predictions*. Here’s how we’ll do it, starting with the order 2 character-level Markov model of `condescendences`: (1) start with the initial n-gram (`co`)—those are the first two characters of our output. (2) Now, look at the last *n* characters of output, where *n* is the order of the n-grams in our table, and find those characters in the “n-grams” column. (3) Choose randomly among the possibilities in the corresponding “next” column, and append that letter to the output. (Sometimes, as with `co`, there’s only one possibility).
