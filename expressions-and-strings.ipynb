    "## Expressions and evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a very high-level description of how computer programming works. When you're writing a computer program, you're describing to the computer what you want, and then asking the computer to figure that thing out for you. Your description of what you want is called an *expression*. The process that the computer uses to turn your expression into whatever that expression means is called *evaluation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a science fiction movie where a character asks the computer, out loud, \"What's the square root of nine billion?\" or \"How many people older than 50 live in Paris, France?\" Those are examples of expressions. The process that the computer uses to transform those expressions into a response is evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the process of evaluation is complete, you're left with a single \"value\". Think of it schematically like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Expression -> Evaluation -> Value](http://static.decontextualize.com/snaps/expressiondiagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes computer programs powerful is that they make it possible to write very precise and sophisticated expressions. And importantly, you can embed the results of evaluating one expression inside of another expression, or save the results of evaluating an expression for later in your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, computers (before LLMs) can't understand and intuit your desires simply from a verbal description. That's why we need computer programming languages: to give us a way to write expressions in a way that the computer can understand. Because programming languages are designed to be precise, they can also be persnickety (and frustrating). And every programming language is different. It's tricky, but worth it."

In the example below, `3 + 5` is the expression. You can tell Python to evaluate the expression and display its value simply by typing in the expression in a new notebook cell and typing CTRL+ENTER."

Python also has a powerful way for you to write expressions that return a *section* of a string, starting from a particular index and ending with another index. In Python parlance we'll call this section a *slice*.\n",

The difference is that instead of putting one number between square brackets, we put *two* numbers, separated by a colon.
